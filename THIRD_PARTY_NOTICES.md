## sing-box libbox

The Android build generates `libbox.aar` and `libbox-legacy.aar` from the
official sing-box v1.14.3 source under `.build/sing-box/` using the upstream
`cmd/internal/build_libbox` generator. The pinned source is checked out from
https://github.com/SagerNet/sing-box/tree/v1.14.3 and is licensed under
GPL-3.0-or-later. The Android workflow retains the corresponding source as
the `sing-box-source-v1.14.3` artifact alongside the APK.

## FlClash Android VPN service design

Brew's Android VPN service lifecycle has been adapted using Android TUN lifecycle
patterns and operational safeguards from [FlClash](https://github.com/chen08209/FlClash),
Copyright the FlClash contributors. FlClash is distributed under the GNU General
Public License v3.0 (GPL-3.0); Brew is also licensed under GPL-3.0-or-later.

FlClash's `Core` and `ServiceController` classes are tied to its own Go Mobile
bridge and are not drop-in compatible with Brew. This adaptation retains Brew's
`libmihomo-android` bridge and existing Flutter method-channel contract.
